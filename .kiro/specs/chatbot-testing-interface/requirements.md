# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a chatbot testing interface that allows users to interact with and test their AI chatbots directly within the dashboard before deploying them to their websites. This feature provides users with the ability to validate chatbot responses, test different scenarios, and refine their chatbot configuration in a controlled environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has created a chatbot, I want to test it directly in the dashboard, so that I can validate its responses before embedding it on my website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or selects a chatbot THEN the system SHALL provide a "Test Chatbot" or "Preview" option
2. WHEN a user clicks the test option THEN the system SHALL open an interactive chat interface within the dashboard
3. WHEN a user sends a message in the test interface THEN the chatbot SHALL respond using the same AI logic as the embedded version
4. WHEN a user tests the chatbot THEN the system SHALL apply all configured settings (personality, appearance, knowledge base)
5. WHEN a user interacts with the test interface THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context throughout the session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user testing my chatbot, I want to see how it appears with my custom styling, so that I can verify the visual design before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the test interface THEN the system SHALL display the chatbot with all configured appearance settings
2. WHEN a user has customized colors and fonts THEN the test interface SHALL reflect these visual changes
3. WHEN a user has uploaded an avatar THEN the test interface SHALL display the custom avatar
4. WHEN a user changes appearance settings THEN the test interface SHALL update in real-time or after refresh
5. IF a user has not configured appearance THEN the system SHALL show default styling in the test interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user testing my chatbot, I want to reset the conversation and try different scenarios, so that I can thoroughly test various use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in the test interface THEN the system SHALL provide a "Reset Conversation" or "Clear Chat" button
2. WHEN a user clicks reset THEN the system SHALL clear all messages and start a fresh conversation
3. WHEN a user resets the conversation THEN the system SHALL maintain the chatbot's configuration and settings
4. WHEN a user starts a new test session THEN the system SHALL begin with any configured greeting message
5. WHEN a user tests multiple scenarios THEN each reset SHALL provide a clean slate for testing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user testing my chatbot, I want to see conversation metadata and debug information, so that I can understand how my chatbot is performing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is testing the chatbot THEN the system SHALL optionally display response times and token usage
2. WHEN a user enables debug mode THEN the system SHALL show which knowledge base entries were used
3. WHEN a user views test conversations THEN the system SHALL display confidence scores or AI model information
4. WHEN a user encounters errors THEN the system SHALL show helpful error messages and troubleshooting tips
5. IF the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display fallback messages as configured

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who has tested my chatbot, I want to easily transition to getting the embed code, so that I can deploy my validated chatbot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user finishes testing THEN the system SHALL provide a clear path to get the embed code
2. WHEN a user is satisfied with testing THEN the system SHALL offer a "Get Embed Code" or "Deploy" button
3. WHEN a user requests the embed code THEN the system SHALL generate it with all current chatbot settings
4. WHEN a user copies the embed code THEN the system SHALL provide integration instructions and documentation
5. WHEN a user deploys the chatbot THEN the embedded version SHALL behave identically to the tested version

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple chatbots, I want to quickly access the test interface for any of my chatbots, so that I can efficiently manage and validate them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their chatbot list THEN the system SHALL provide quick access to test each chatbot
2. WHEN a user is editing a chatbot THEN the system SHALL offer immediate testing without leaving the edit flow
3. WHEN a user switches between chatbots THEN the test interface SHALL load the correct chatbot configuration
4. WHEN a user has multiple test sessions THEN the system SHALL handle them independently
5. WHEN a user closes a test interface THEN the system SHALL return them to the appropriate dashboard page
